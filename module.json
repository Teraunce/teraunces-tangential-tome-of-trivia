If you’re running a different campaign, you could mark entirely different spells as forgotten. You could even do so for your own Everglow campaign, as the GM. Forgotten is not written in stone as a mechanical requirement for the spell. Instead, it is another tool to increase mystery and provide treasure for your players to go for that isn’t a shiny artifact, but instead something in a book that may be just as valuable.</p>"

Like most scrap equipment, their appearance can vary wildly, from wearing a rubber tire to old sport equipment repurposed to survival gear. Often clunkier than traditional armor, they can be easily modified to suit the needs of the wearer in the hands of a skilled artisan. All scavenged armors have the scrap quality."

How to assemble one of the pre-Blaze models properly is beyond the means of the ashen age, but cobbling together pieces and forging it into something that could serve as a stand-in is possible. Usually with smooth bores and made of different pieces welded together, they have a very distinctive appearance. While many are jury-rigged to use common scrap-bullets, if the user is blessed with the real thing, their misfire is reduced by 1. Though they come in many, more specific, varieties, we will present the basic models and allow your imagination to fill in the holes. Firearms without the scrap quality are all considered priceless and beyond the current methods of production."
