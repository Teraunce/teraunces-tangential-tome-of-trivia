If you’re running a different campaign, you could mark entirely different spells as forgotten. You could even do so for your own Everglow campaign, as the GM. Forgotten is not written in stone as a mechanical requirement for the spell. Instead, it is another tool to increase mystery and provide treasure for your players to go for that isn’t a shiny artifact, but instead something in a book that may be just as valuable.</span> </p>"
