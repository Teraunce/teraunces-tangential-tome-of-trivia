The caster must choose which heightened effects will apply as if purchasing them with the extra levels the spell is heightened by. The same heighten effect can be purchased multiple times. These decisions are made while casting the spell.</span></p><h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Forgotten Spells</span></h1><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Spells with the forgotten descriptor are lost to time. They are not available to be taken on level up, found in stores, or accessible even to divine casters. Only after finding the spell and studying it can the spell be accessed. A wizard could then scribe it into their book, and a cleric could pray for the spell the next time they regain spells.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This is specific to Everglow. If you’re running a different campaign, you could mark entirely different spells as forgotten. You could even do so for your own Everglow campaign, as the GM. Forgotten is not written in stone as a mechanical requirement for the spell. Instead, it is another tool to increase mystery and provide treasure for your players to go for that isn’t a shiny artifact, but instead something in a book that may be just as valuable.</span> </p><h1>Concealed</h1><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Spells and actions with this trait require you be psionically centered to use. Many expend this center as a result.</span> <br style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;orphans:2;text-align:-webkit-auto;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px\" /></p>"
